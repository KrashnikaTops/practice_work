52.How Many Basic Types Of Functions Are Available In Python?  

ans:-

1.Built-in Functions: These are functions provided by Python itself, such as len(), print(), type(), max(), and min(). 
                    -They are readily available for use without needing to import any libraries.


2.Lambda Functions: These are small anonymous functions defined with the lambda keyword. 
                  -They are often used for short, throwaway functions. 

                  example: square = lambda x: x ** 2
                  
3.User-Defined Functions: These are functions that you create yourself using the def keyword.
